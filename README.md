Web Mapping Lab
This map shows the number of people using bike in each station from October 13th, 2014, to October 12th, 2015. The bike data is available online, and the basemap data I used are from WAGDA.
The orange line indicates bike lanes. 

Color:
I used green for bike count. There are two reasons why I chose this color. First, bike count element is the main and green makes it standout. Second, as the theme color of Pronto (the bike share progam) is green, it is good to keep consistant.
